# Nand2TetrisGame
A game in jack compiler week 9 in nand2tetris 
This game is very similar to chrome's dinosaur game, just here instead of a man and cactos we have a man jumping over bushes.
The game flows while the man manages to jump over the trees that come towards him,
if the man's dreaming or too late the game will stop and the player will lose.
As long as the man manages not to touch the bushes the game will continue and ihis score will rise.
in order to get the man to jump the player should use the space keyboard.
